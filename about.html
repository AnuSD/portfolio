          <p>As a front-end developer, I believe this field enables us to bring our ideas to reality. I design, create, test, and maintain software applications. I am proficient in various programming languages such as HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and many others. I use these languages to write the code that forms the foundation of software applications.</p>
          <p>"Imagine you're building a complex Lego structure. The purpose of being a good Lego engineer is to make sure your creation is complicated enough to do what you want (like having moving parts) but not so complicated that it becomes a mess and hard to understand or fix. In software, it's similar â€“ we want our programs to be smart and do what we need, but we also want to keep them organized and easy to work with, so they're not a headache to manage."</p>

            "Despite having completed my M.Sc., the lockdown provided me with the opportunity to explore various websites, and I discovered a profound interest in web development. Recognizing the potential to bring ideas to life through website creation, I decided to pivot and actively pursued this field. The journey has been immensely rewarding, and I am now confident in my abilities to design and develop websites."</p>
